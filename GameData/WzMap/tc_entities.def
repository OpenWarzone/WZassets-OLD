/*QUAKED ammo_bfg (.3 .3 1) (-20 -20 -16) (20 20 20) SUSPENDED
BFG ammo. Gives the player 15 by default.
-------- KEYS --------
wait : time in seconds before item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).
count: sets the amount of ammo given to the player when picked up (default 15).
team : set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).
target : picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.
targetname : a target_give entity can point to this for respawn freebies.
gametype: gametypes may be ctf, commandpoint, oneflag. these entities will only spawn in these gametypes if it's specified. WFA is considered Q3A CTF.
notbot : used to make an item invisible for bot attraction.
wf_team : can be set to "1" (red) or "2" (blue)
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SUSPENDED : item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

/*QUAKED func_pendulum (0 .5 .8) ?
Solid entity that describes a pendulum back and forth rotation movement. Rotates on the X axis by default. Pendulum frequency is a physical constant based on the length of the beam and gravity. Blocking the pendulum instantly kills a player.
-------- KEYS --------
angle : angle offset of axis of rotation from default X axis (default 0).
speed : angle of swing arc in either direction from initial position (default 30).
phase : sets the start offset of the swinging cycle. Values must be 0 < phase < 1. Any integer phase value is the same as no offset (default 0).
noise : path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/jets/jets01.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of entity's rotation axis and .md3 model included with entity (default "0 0 0" - See Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
gametype: gametypes may be ctf, commandpoint, oneflag. these entities will only spawn in these gametypes if it's specified. WFA is considered Q3A CTF.
inskyroom: when set to 1, entity will be visible through the skyportal's camera
-------- NOTES --------
Players will DIE when they touch this.
You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. Pendulum will rotate along the X axis by default. Very crude operation: pendulum cannot rotate along Z axis, the speed of swing (frequency) is not adjustable. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

It is possible to rotate misc_models and brushmodels at any angle on any (or multiple) axes. It's just a little-known and undocumented feature:

Make a func_pendulum (out of, say, a nodraw brush), and attach the model to it using a model2 key. Now, give the func_pendulum a speed of 0, and instead of using the "angle" key, use an "angles" key (note the "s") and give it a pitch-yaw-roll value (e.g. 45 90 45) to position your model at whatever angle you wish. It will take a little experimentation, but pitch is up-and-down angle, yaw is compass direction, and roll is sideways angle.

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED func_plat (0 .5 .8) ?
Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off. There are no proper sounds for this entity, only beep noises. It will spawn in the game and work properly but it sounds silly (see Notes).
-------- KEYS --------
speed : determines how fast the plat moves (default 150).
lip : lip remaining at end of move (default 16). Has no effect if "height" is set.
height : if set, this will determine the total amount of vertical travel of the plat.
dmg : damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation of plat (default 4). Plat will reverse direction when blocked.
targetname : if set, the trigger that points to this will raise the plat each time it fires. The plat raises and comes back down a second later if no player is on it.
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
gametype: gametypes may be ctf, commandpoint, oneflag. these entities will only spawn in these gametypes if it's specified. WFA is considered Q3A CTF.
wf_team : can be set to "1" (red) or "2" (blue)
inskyroom: when set to 1, entity will be visible through the skyportal's camera
-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

There is a way to make plats play proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put 2 sounds named pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3 file or new custom sounds if you're up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla for the tip.*/

/*QUAKED func_rotating (0 .5 .8) ? - - X_AXIS Y_AXIS
Solid entity that rotates continuously. Rotates on the Z axis by default and requires an origin brush. It will always start on in the game and is not targetable.
-------- KEYS --------
speed : determines how fast entity rotates (default 100).
noise : path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/bitch/fembotbig.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of entity's rotation axis and .md3 model included with entity (default "0 0 0" - See Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
gametype: gametypes may be ctf, commandpoint, oneflag. these entities will only spawn in these gametypes if it's specified. WFA is considered Q3A CTF.
inskyroom: when set to 1, entity will be visible through the skyportal's camera
angles: pitch yaw roll
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
X_AXIS : entity will rotate along the X axis.
Y_AXIS : entity will rotate along the Y axis.
-------- NOTES --------
You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. It will rotate along the Z axis by default. You can check either the X_AXIS or Y_AXIS box to change that. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.*/

It is possible to rotate misc_models and brushmodels at any angle on any (or multiple) axes.

For misc_models: Make a func_rotating (out of, say, a nodraw brush), and attach the model to it using a model2 key. Now, give the func_pendulum a speed of 0, and instead of using the "angle" key, use an "angles" key (note the "s") and give it a pitch-yaw-roll value (e.g. 45 90 45) to position your model at whatever angle you wish. It will take a little experimentation, but pitch is up-and-down angle, yaw is compass direction, and roll is sideways angle.

/*QUAKED func_static (0 .5 .8) ?
Static non-solid bspmodel. Can be used for conditional walls and models.
-------- KEYS --------
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/bitch/fembotbig.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
targetname : if set, a func_button or trigger can make entity disappear from the game (See Notes).
gametype: gametypes may be ctf, commandpoint, oneflag. these entities will only spawn in these gametypes if it's specified. WFA is considered Q3A CTF.
inskyroom: when set to 1, entity will be visible through the skyportal's camera
-------- NOTES --------
When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value. If a model is included with a targeted func_static, the brush(es) of the entity will be removed from the game but the .md3 model won't: it will automatically be moved to the (0 0 0) world origin so you should NOT include an .md3 model to a targeted func_static.

Because the map has only a single bot navigation file, func_static's cannot be used to make significant changes in game play flow between differing game types.*/

/*QUAKED func_particle (1 0 .83) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) START_ON MODE_2
Spawn some particles.
-------- KEYS --------
target : Target the spawner at a target_position.
targetname : If set, a func_button or trigger can turn this spawner on and off.
xrandom : Adds randomness to the particle spawn in the X-Axis. (Default is 0.)
yrandom : Adds randomness to the particle spawn in the Y-Axis. (Default is 0.)
zrandom : Adds randomness to the particle spawn in the Z-Axis. (Default is 0.)
pcolor : This is a set of normalized RGB values for the color of the particles. (Default is 1.0 1.0 1.0, See Notes Below.)
velocity : Modifies the particle velocity. (Default is 100)
duration : Controls the life of each particle, in milliseconds. (Default is 3000.)
frequency : Controls how often the spawner generates a particle. (Default is 0.  See Notes below.)
speed : Controls the upward drift speed of particle movement for MODE_2 only.(See notes below.)
width : Sets the starting width of the particles (Default is 1.)
height : Sets the starting height of the particles (Default is 1.)
srandom : Allows individual particle sizes to be randomized within one spawner. (Default is 0. See Notes below.)
endsize : Sets a multiplier to be used with the width and height to determine the end size of the particles when their durations expire. (Default is 1.  See Notes below.)
ptype : Determines which graphic is used for each particle sprite. (Default is 1, See Notes Below.)
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
START_ON : The particle spawner will start in the ON position, spawning particles.
MODE_2 : Alternate particle behavior mode, see notes below.
-------- NOTES --------
***NOTE*** YOU MUST TARGET THIS AT A TARGET_POSITION ***NOTE***
Func_particle is a fairly complicated entity.  The xrandom, yrandom, and zrandom parameters allow you to increase the particle spread in all directions.  A good starting place is around 50 in each to direction for a mild spread.  If you leave them all at 0 you will get a straight line of particles.  Velocity modifies the "force" that propels the particles in the direction of your target_position.  The default is 100 and is generally a good starting point unless you need your particles to go long distances.
Duration controls how long a particle will stay around before fading itself out of existance.  You want this number as low as possible while still generating the effect you are after.  A particle that hits a solid object (like a floor) will be deleted automatically and will not float down to lower levels.  Frequency controls how many particles the spawn spits out per unit of time.  The default is 0 which allows the spawner to go at full speed.  A setting of 10 will lessen the number of particles significantly so do not set this value too large initially.
Pcolor allows you to select the color of the particles being emitted.  This key requires 3 normalized RGB values in x.x format, each separated by a space.  This is the same format as the color key for light entities.  It should look something like this:  0.4 0.9 0.2

Ptype allows you to select the graphic used on each particle sprite.  WFA includes 8 "pre-made" particle images and allows 2 "custom" images per map.  To use a custom image, you must make a shader named <mapname>_particle1 or <mapname>_particle2  where mapname is the BSP name (without directory structure) of your map (For instance, cancer1-wfa_particle1.)  The pre-made particle descriptions are listed below :

Type 1		Generic particle
Type 2		Generic bubble (Under Water Only)
Type 3		Large Flare
Type 4		Small Flare
Type 5		Smoke Puff (BLACK, DON'T SPECIFY COLOR)
Type 6		Snow Flake
Type 7		Four Point Star
Type 8		Steam Puff
Type 9		<mapname>_particle1 CUSTOM PARTICLE GRAPHIC
Type 10		<mapname>_particle2 CUSTOM PARTICLE GRAPHIC

The last two types must be a black and white jpg for color to work. See the particle shader in the pak for examples of already sepcified sprites.

MODE_2 changes the way the particles behave significantly.  Instead of being effected by gravity, they work in the opposite (somewhat like smoke.)  They try to rise towards the ceiling based on the speed parameter (if set to 0, they defy gravity.)  Additionally, when modifying the X,Y,and Z-randoms the ORIGIN is modified, not the trajectory.  This allows for the creation of particle "fields."

The srandom key allows you to randomize particle sizes within one spawner.  The same random value is applied to both the height and the width to preserve the size ratio for any given particle.  The formula for particle size looks like this:

	randomSize = ( <random fraction between 0 and 1> * <the Srandom key> );
	height = <the height key> + randomSize;
	width = <the width key> + randomSize;
	endheight = (<the height key> + randomSize) * <the endsize key>;
	endwidth = (<the width key> + randomSize) * <the endsize key>;

In short, you never want the srandom key to be larger than the height or the width.  This would potential cause particles with a negative size since the srandom key represent the MAXIMUM deviance that can occur for any particle.  This number can be positive or negative.  

The endsize key is a multiplier that is applied to the width and height to determine the end size of the particles when their durations expire.  You can use this to cause particles to shrink or grow during the course of their lives (But not both, and size change is linear.)  This number is positive for growth and negative for shrinkage.

As an additional note, you CAN point this entity at a moving entity (such as a door or a func_train) and it will adjust the direction of the spray of particles as its target entity moves around the world.  It does not currently adjust it's velocity.
Keep in mind that the 'origin' of a door is not neccessarily the center. If you want to point it to a mover, it -can help- to make a small brush as the center of the mover and select that brush first when creating the entity.

/*QUAKED item_botroam (.8 .3 .0) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) SUSPENDED
Game Function: An invisible entity which attracts a bot to it. Use to move bots to parts of a map that might otherwise not be used (NEW ENTITY).
-------- KEYS --------
weight: non-zero floating point value, most often in the range 0 to 400. (Higher values are allowed but keep in mind that the bot should also be attracted to normal items.  Don't make the weight value too high.

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SUSPENDED : item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.
-------- NOTES --------
The item_botroam entity can be used when a bot does not roam the whole level or prefers to go to only specific areas. This (invisible) item can be placed in a map just like regular items. Nobody can actually pick up the item it's only used to attract bots to certain places of the map. The value is the weight of the roam_item is relative to the weight assigned other items in the map (each bot has its own weights). The bot character specific item weights are stored with the bot characters AI files ("botname"_i.c for items and "botname"_w.c for weapons) in the botfiles/bots/ sub-folder in the .pk3 file.*/

model : path/name of model to use (eg: models/mapobjects/teleporter/teleporter.md3).
_celshader: this is the shader name for 'cell shading', ex: cel/ink 
"modelscale"	scale multiplier (defaults to 1x)
"modelscale_vec"	scale multiplier (defaults to 1 1 1, scales each axis as requested)
"modelscale_vec" - Set scale per-axis.  Overrides "modelscale", so if you have both, the "modelscale" is ignored

**NOTES**

It is possible to rotate misc_models at any angle on any (or multiple) axes. It's just a little-known and undocumented feature:

Make a func_pendulum (out of, say, a nodraw brush), and attach the model to it using a model2 key. Now, give the func_pendulum a speed of 0, and instead of using the "angle" key, use an "angles" key (note the "s") and give it a pitch-yaw-roll value (e.g. 45 90 45) to position your model at whatever angle you wish. It will take a little experimentation, but pitch is up-and-down angle, yaw is compass direction, and roll is sideways angle.

/*QUAKED target_speaker (.2 .7 .7) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) LOOPED_ON LOOPED_OFF GLOBAL ACTIVATOR BROADCAST
Sound generating entity that plays .wav files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.
-------- KEYS --------
noise : path/name of .wav file to play (eg. sound/world/growl1.wav - see Notes).
wait : delay in seconds between each time the sound is played ("random" key must be set - see Notes).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay ("wait" key must be set - see Notes).
targetname : the activating button or trigger points to this.
gametype: gametypes may be ctf, commandpoint, oneflag. these entities will only spawn in these gametypes if it's specified. WFA is considered Q3A CTF.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
LOOPED_ON : sound will loop and initially start on in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
LOOPED_OFF : sound will loop and initially start off in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
GLOBAL : sound will play full volume throughout the level.
ACTIVATOR : sound will play only for the player that activated the target.
BROADCAST : sound will play throughout the level but has attenuation (gets softer as you get further)
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).*/

ambient : Adds a constant value to overall lighting. Use is not recommended. Ambient light will have a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.
_color : RGB value for ambient, gridlight, minvertexlight, minlight. (default is 0 0 0).
_lightmapscale: used for lightmap sampling. If you have any func_ ents and the _lightmapscale is not specified on those ents, this won't affect them.
_foghull: used to point to the shader you want to use as your foghull. Ex: textures/foghull/foghull_sky
_farplanedist: This is the setting for which visclusters will be culled. ***** USE THE "trailbroadcast" "1" key/value with this *****
_celshader: this is the shader name for 'cell shading', ex: cel/ink
gravity : gravity of level (default is normal gravity: 800).
gridsize : This can also be set with the common/lightgrid shader. Granularity of the lightgrid created by q3map. Value is three integers separated by spaces, representing number of units between grid points in X Y Z. Default gridsize value is 128 128 256. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.
_blocksize : q3map always splits the BSP tree along the planes X=_blocksize*n and Y=_blocksize*n. Default _blocksize value is 1024. Increase the blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times on very large maps with a low structural brush density.
_noshadersun: Use "1" or not at all. Disables the q3map_sun parameter in shaders, used with a sun light entity. See the "Light" description for more information.
_minlight : Minimum light level (better then ambient, raises the low-end (black) clamp level.
_minvertexlight : Minimum vertex light level
_mingridlight: Minimum light grid level
_keeplights: Set to 1 to stop the stripping of lights during compile
-------- NOTES --------
Celshading is a simple technique for simulating ink outlines around 3d objects. The ink drawsurfs are huge non-planer continuous black meshes. Should really really use metasurface merger for a nice effect.
Lightmapscale default is 1, equal to 32 samples per luxel. going up makes for coarser lightmaps, going down makes for finer ones. Alot of the bsp size can be attributed to the finer detailed lightmaps so use your judgement. Lightmapscale can chew the hell out of your ram quicker then you may realize. It may be better to just add it to the func_groups you wish a nice effect to appear on.
minlight and minvertexlight: These work like ambient light, using the worldspawn _color key to set a minimum lighting value (as opposed to base lighting value for ambient) for lightmaps or vertexes in the world. Good for brightening up totally black areas if necessary.
